# What is Japanese for Developers?

This project was built to help in my journey to become a front end developer at a Japanese company. Although I currently work as a translator in Tokyo, tech specific words are quite far from what I work with in my 9 to 5. Figuring my situation wasn't entirely unique I decided to make Japanese for Developers. This repo contains a plethora of vocab and phrases collected from all over the web and from the github community. If you would like to contribute and add your own translations please read the how to contribute section for more details!

## How to use Japanese for Developers?

The content of Japanese for Developers is available in two different ways. You can either chose a category from below to view the markup page on github, or you can traverse our github pages site (coming soon).

General Vocab
Interview Prep
Dealing with Clients

### How to contribute?

note: The project website was built with react and aggregated into a single json file and the github repo is mainly in markdown. When adding new vocabulary, *please add them in both locations*. 


### Note 

Before pushing any new user contributions to our page, we try and have at least 1 other person approve the translation to help with accuracy! If you find any translations that are old/outdated or just plain wrong please make a pull request with the correct translation!
